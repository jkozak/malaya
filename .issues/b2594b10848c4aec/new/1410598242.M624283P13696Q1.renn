Journal writes with sync are slow.  Under posix, try this:
don't open log O_APPEND, open it O_WRITE and allocate
sector buffers which are initially zeroed.  Fill this up as
per normal, and write out the full sector.  This means
we don't need to rewrite the metadata each time (because
the file size hasn't changed); saves a seek.
