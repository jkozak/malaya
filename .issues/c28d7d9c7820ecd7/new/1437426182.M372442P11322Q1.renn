Subject: `lock` handling code can mis-attribute pid
Message-Id: <c28d7d9c7820ecd7-0-artemis@renn>

Especially at startup when all pids are similar.  If there's a
`lock` and the pid in it is owned by an extant process, malaya won't
start.

Fix this by adding process-start-time to lock file and checking it.
