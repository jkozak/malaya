Subject: add mechanism for saving links in hash stores
Message-Id: <e3d38162687d3e73-0-artemis@renn>

filesystem-friendly way for adding type info to a hash store:
 - add file
 - create link to file with extension

Needs a commitment to make it continue working if (as we should) we
add multi-level directory stores.
