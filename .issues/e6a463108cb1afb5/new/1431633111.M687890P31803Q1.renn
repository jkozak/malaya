Subject: on `nvm` versions, require of a temp file with dependencies fails
Message-Id: <e6a463108cb1afb5-0-artemis@renn>
resolution: fixed

see for example `test/cmdline.js`

Fails on `nvm use v0.10.29`
Works on `nvm use system`

Can't I not just use `compiler.compile` instead of `require` in
engine.js's exports.compile?
