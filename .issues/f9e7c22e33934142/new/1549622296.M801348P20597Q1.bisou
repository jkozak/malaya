Subject: big world files slow to load
Message-Id: <f9e7c22e33934142-0-artemis@bisou>
resolution: fixed

Loading a 23M world file took 3 mins.  Somewhat atypical file insofar
as it contained a lot of base64 binary crud that shouldn't have been
there, but anyway.

Increasing the buffer size in `util.readFileLinesSync` fies this in a
nicely linear way (increase by factor of 64, takes 3 secs).
