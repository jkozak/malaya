Subject: prevalence should lock its directory
State: resolved
Message-Id: <fe2cfd8f8718b481-0-artemis@renn>
resolution: fixed

see npm package lockfile - [later] it's a bid weedy - doesn't check
staleness well (should use the pidfile mechanism), also should use the
guaranteed atomic hard linking trick.
