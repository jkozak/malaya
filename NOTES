Visualisation
-------------

CHR should visualise quite well:

 store         rule
  ...       ... ... ... 
  ...       ... ...
  ...       ... ... ... ....
           (one ... per term)

Highlight active term in store and rule in red
and matching terms in store in other colours.
Rest grey?
non-quiescent facts glow.
Glow new arrivals and fade to merely active.
Animate deletions.
reflow at end of input/transaction.

Show each term as a box containing first element,

Control panel showing full versions of current rule
and active fact.

Use emoji for a quick visual "type".  Or just a
plain old icon library.

It's a Hollywood interface!

Forced-directed layout:
 * Facts repel each other.
 * Facts are attracted:
  * to one another when joined
  * to the centre when:
   * mentioned in a rule (small)
   * mentioned in a fired rule (big)

Set icons by a rule; also context menu items as
<name>,<binding-match>,<fact>

Perhaps I should use `immutable-js` for the fact store:

Performance
-----------

Using an SSD (the one on `renn`) get just below 1k updates/sec
journalised (as opposed to about 20 on a rotary drive!).  Using the
'kludge' setting get 14k.  Should get a factor of four speedup using
the technique in ticket b2594b10848c4aec, so expect 4k updates/sec on
cheap stock hardware.


Type Inference
--------------

could have input definitions to supply type info:

store {

   rule (['Permissions',
}
