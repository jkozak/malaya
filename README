Malaya
======

How to get started
------------------

Use linux.  The core stuff should work on windows, but the Makefile at
least is linux specific. 

Install `nodejs`.  I've run the tests against 0.10.29,0.10.36,0.12.0
io.js 1.4.3 and 1.5.0.  Probably won't work with earlier versions.
Most distributions have a nodejs package: _but_ you need `npm` as
well.  You may shortly be placing your immortal soul in jeopardy by
installing `npm` from outside the distribution, so you may as well
install `nvm` which manages multiple parallel versions of node+tools.

Given you've installed it at ~/malaya and have GNU make and a C
compiler installed you should be able to do this:

 $ cd ~/malaya
 $ make tests

all 150+ tests should pass.


What else can I do with it?
---------------------------

See ~/malaya/examples/idb/README

Can compile `chrjs` files with ~/malaya/bin/chrjsc`: resulting
`.chrjs.js` files can be `require`d and used elsewhere, nothing else
from malaya should be needed (does need `underscore`).


Hollywood interface
-------------------

Requires `node-webkit`.  Instructions to come, but, if you have it
installed and have initialised the IDB example prevalent store above:

 $ cd ~/malaya/examples/gui
 $ nw .

will bring up the gui.  It's pretty picky about `node-webkit`
versions at the moment: I'm using v0.10.4
