Malaya has been restructured into separate npm modules:
 malaya            - compiler and runtime
 wsh               - minimal batch posix shell (for windows)
 examples/chat     - the chat application
 examples/idb  
 examples/auction

Next, split it into separate repositories and move to git.

If you're using the debian or derived `nodejs`, need to set npm prefix
to something writeable, such as ~/npm, so add this to ~/.npmrc:
 prefix = MY_HOME_DIRECTORY/npm

There is a top level Makefile which will build and test everything:
 renn:~/malaya$ make clean
 renn:~/malaya$ make init
 renn:~/malaya$ make test

For windows, need to set an environment variable (WTF doesn't npm do this?):
 NODE_PATH = %USERPROFILE%\AppData\npm\node_modules
 
and also `wsh` which is some glue for windows:
 C:\malaya> npm install -g wsh

The `npm link` mechanism doesn't seem to work under windows, so let's
leave this until we have it on some kind of npm repository.
