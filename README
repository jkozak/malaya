Malaya
======

How to get started
------------------

Use linux.  The core stuff should work on windows, but the Makefile at
least is linux specific. 

Install `nodejs`.  I've run the tests against 0.10.29,0.10.36,0.12.0
io.js 1.4.3 and 1.5.0.  Probably won't work with earlier versions.
Most distributions have a nodejs package: _but_ you need `npm` as
well.  You may shortly be placing your immortal soul in jeopardy by
installing `npm` from outside the distribution, so you may as well
install `nvm` which manages multiple parallel versions of node+tools.

Given you've installed it at ~/malaya and have GNU make and a C
compiler installed you should be able to do this:

 $ cd ~/malaya
 $ make tests

All 250+ tests should pass.


What else can I do with it?
---------------------------

See ~/malaya/examples/idb/README and ~/malaya/examples/chat/README
for examples.

Basically, create a directory, create the chrjs file there as
`bl.chrjs` then do:

 $ ~/malaya/malaya init
 $ ~/malaya/malaya run

This will start a websocket server on port 3000.  You can connect to
it from another terminal, in the same directory:

 $ ~/malaya/malaya client

You can then hurl pieces of json at your server.  You can have
multiple client  running for extra excitement.


Also, can compile `chrjs` files with `~/malaya/malaya compile`:
resulting `.chrjs.js` files can be `require`d and used elsewhere,
nothing else from malaya should be needed (does need `underscore`).


Hollywood interface
-------------------

Broken at the moment, waiting until `nwjs` 0.13 ships to fix it.


Does it run on windows?
-----------------------

New runtime not tested yet.
