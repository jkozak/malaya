* Introduction

Malaya is a logic-based relational data manipulation and storage
system.

There's a class of applications which are about taking in data from a
variety of sources, weaving them together with past data and sending
appropriate data out.

Such applications include:
 - trading systems
 - messaging systems, client/server and distributed
 - instrumentation and control, e.g. IoT
 - CI systems, chat bots

Malaya is designed to make this easier.  It is a system for the
concise and rapid expression, implementation and deployment of
rule-based persistent reactive systems.  Data is everywhere JSON;
Persistent storage is based around a hash-chained journal of updates
which is tamper-proof and maintains the system's entire history; it is
thus eminently auditable.

It consists of:
 - JSON pattern matching
 - a logic programming system based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_Handling_Rules][CHR]]
 - a persistence layer based on prevalence
 - plugins to implement
  - timers
  - sockets
  - websocket
  - REST
  - file I/O
  - slack, matrix, SSb, IRC, &c
  - stripe
  - email

The current implementation is in-memory and runs on top of ~nodejs~;
it should run wherever that runs.

Malaya is developed on linux and LTS versions of ~nodejs~.

Examples and documentation to come.  The language is nearly stable;
the codebase is currently in-flux but expected to settle down by
mid-2019 for comment as version 0.9.*: a 1.0.0 release is anticipated
by the beginning of 2020.
