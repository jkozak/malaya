One data format from end to end, because with each conversion
constraints are imposed, and these add up as data flows through the
system in ways that are not obvious when looking at each individual
stage. Example: the front-end expects things to be structured around
instruments, and expects to have a complete list of these.
Integrating the SIS system has meant that this is no longer true, but
it's quite a deep seated assumption; worked round it by bending the
definition of instruments - but this can have knock-on effects elsewhere.

Data format is JSON: this is now generally preferred to it predecessor,
XML.  XML was written for word processing originally and primarily is
designed to handle text; JSON also handles numbers, list of things and
other things one actually needs.

The original part of Malaya is the logic/relational/persistence
engine at its heart.  Bits of data (JSON) go into it, rattle about,
and chuck out new bits of data.  


Gold standard: Don Syme at Standard Chartered: team meeting first
thing, code changes in morning, deployed to customers in afternoon.
I am not promising this; but I do think it's a goal that could
for which we could plausibly strive with this technology.
