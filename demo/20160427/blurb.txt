An introduction to the Malaya nodejs-embedded logic programming system
======================================================================

This talk will be an introduction to the Malaya formalism, language
and environment.  It will include a workshop for attendees to
experiment with a sample Malaya system, learning a new and
increasingly popular logic programming model in the process.

Malaya is a server-side framework for designing and implementing the
business logic of small-to-medium sized systems, somewhat
theoretically grounded yet pragmatic.  It consists of:

 * a DSL embedded in javascript derived from the CHR logic programming
   formalism
 * a prevalent data persistence mechanism

It is usable at the moment but under active development and liable to
change.
