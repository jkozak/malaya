Malaya, or the Utopia of Business Rules
=======================================

Malaya is a server-side framework for designing and implementing the
business logic of small-to-medium sized business systems, somewhat
theoretically grounded yet pragmatic.  It consists of:

* a DSL embedded in javascript derived from the CHR logic programming
   formalism
 * a prevalent data persistence mechanism

It is usable at the moment but under active development and liable to
change.
