To run:

 $ ./init && ./malaya run

Point browser at port 3000

Valid credentials can be found at ./data/init.json - once logged on,
credentials should stick to a tab and one should be able to log
multiple users on in one browser instance.

Reasonably modern browser required; recent FireFox, Chrome, IE>=10
