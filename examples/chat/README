Malaya chat example
===================

To initialise (assume `make tests` has run clean):

 $ cd ~/malaya/examples/chat
 ~/malaya/examples/chat$ ../../malaya init 
 ~/malaya/examples/chat$ ../../malaya run

Ctrl-C to stop and save.

You can then logon with the "client" subcommand:

 ~/malaya/examples/chat$ ../../malaya client
 > ['logon',{user:'JK'}]
 > ['say',{msg:'hi'}]
 > 
 < {"msg":"hi","from":"JK"}
 >

You can run multiple simultaneous sessions, messages entered as above
will broadcast to all.
