Malaya IDB example
==================

The IDB example runs like this (assume `make tests` has run clean):

 $ cd ~/malaya/examples/idb
 $ ./run --fsync none --init init_db.py

Where `init_db.py` is a `dbsync` dump. This builds the prevalent store
then starts the system.

To run thereafter:

 $ ~/malaya/examples/idb/run

Ctrl-C to stop and save.

You should then be able to log FE3 clients into it.  The demo just
does log{on,off} so far, no price/trade/auction yet.

(This will not be part of the free software release)
