Malaya IDB example
==================

To initialise (assume `make tests` has run clean):

 $ cd ~/malaya/examples/idb
 $ ./malaya init data/idb.json

Where `idb.json` is a JSON dump of an IDB db. This builds the
prevalent store.

To run thereafter:

 $ ~/malaya/examples/idb/malaya run

Ctrl-C to stop and save.

You should then be able to log FE3 clients into it.  The demo just
does log{on,off} so far, no price/trade/auction yet.

(This will not be part of the free software release)
