Malaya IDB example
==================

To initialise (assume `make tests` has run clean):

 $ cd ~/malaya/examples/idb
 $ ./idb init -d data/idb.json

Where `idb.json` is a JSON dump of an IDB db. This builds the
prevalent store.

To run thereafter:

 $ ~/malaya/examples/idb/idb run -D

Ctrl-C to stop and save.

You can connect to this with a modern web browser.  I have tested with
chromium, conkeror, edge, and a couple of versions of android chrome.
Needs websockets so non-recent IEs probably won't work.

You should then be able to log FE3 clients into it.  The demo just
does log{on,off}, price (approx), trade (approx), no auction yet.

(This will not be part of the free software release)
