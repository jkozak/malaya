This is a minimal shell to make `make` usable with `node` under windows.

If you're using this you're probably doing something wrong.

The situation that provoked the writing of this was that I had a body
of code running nicely on linux using `make` as a build system.  (It
would have been better to have used `npm` build scripts.  Anyway.)
Next I decided to run this code on windows.  On windows, `make` can be
easily had from `chocolatey`, but doing anything much with it is more
of a challenge without a POSIX shell.  This is enough of a POSIX shell
for my needs.

To use, add this to the start of your `Makefile`:

  ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
    export PATH  := $(PATH);.\node_modules\.bin
    export SHELL := wsh.cmd
  else
    export PATH  := $(PATH):./node_modules/.bin
  endif

If you were sensible and used npm scripts instead of `make`, another
problem presents itself: there doesn't seem to be a portable (linux
and windows) way of setting `NODE_ENV` for testing when using `mocha`
under `npm test`.  To help with this, `wsh` also provides an `env`
command which can be used in npm script definitions:

```
  "scripts": {
    "test": "env NODE_ENV=test mocha -R min test"
  },

```
